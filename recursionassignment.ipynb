    "This is the recursive approach that stores already-calculated results.  \n",

    "##Conclusion \n",
    "All three methods are correct.  \n",
    "The analytic formula is the fastest, the iterative DP is the easiest to code, and the memoized version is good for learning the concept.  \n",
    "For calculating something like f(1000), the analytic one is almost instant, while the DP ones are still quite fast.\n"
